Build an RL-based algorithm which can help cab drivers maximise their profits by improving their decision-making process on the field i.e. choose the rides which are likely to maximise the total profit earned by the driver that day.

If cab is already in use, then the driver won’t get any requests. Otherwise, he may get multiple request(s). He can either decide to take any one of these requests or can go ‘offline’, i.e., not accept any request at all.

Build an agent that learns to pick the best request using DQN.
